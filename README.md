# Optimization (Based on Python)
### 2020 Spring, @cqu
This collection contains my homework or example code for the course. After every chapter, I shall update the files. Each file presents several methods for one problem. If you find any bug, please tell me :-)
### 1. oneDimensionSearch.py
This chapter introduces three optimal methods of one-dimension search, including **Golden section methods** , **Fibonacci methods** which has been abandoned due to its complexity, and **Newton methods**. These methods can only be applied to simple functions like unary function, otherwise it might be trapped in a local optimal solution. 

### 2. GradDescent.py
This unit tells about **gradient descent method**, which helps to find the minimum by always heading the fastest downward direction. Same as one dimension search, it may also enter local optimal solution. You can fix the study ratio (deciding its pace) and starting point to avoid.
